# interactivelogin
A new Flutter app with interactive login.
Made this using #Flutter and #Rive. Following are the animations that this teddy does:
1. Follows as you type.
2. Closes eyes while you enter the password.
3. Reacts happily when credentials match.
4. Reacts sad when credentials don't match.
